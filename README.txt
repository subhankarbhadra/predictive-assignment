Codes for "Scalable community detection in massive networks via predictive assignment" (https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16730)

Tables 2 and 3: Run sim_sbm_sc.R and sim_sbm_basc.R for the different choices of (h, n, K) with N = 30 replications

Table 4: Run newsim1.m, newsim2.m and newsim3.m (within the divconq folder)

Table 5: Run sim_dcbm_rsc.R for the different choices of (h, n, K) with N = 30 replications

Table 6: Run dblp.R and twitch.R

The scripts for cleaning the DBLP dataset and the Twitch dataset from the raw version are: dblp_cleanup.R and twitch_cleanup.R. The processed datasets used in the analysis are stored as: dblp.RData and twitch.RData.
